## Components

### Main Components

- **DiscoverProducts**: The main component that orchestrates the entire discover page
- **ProductFilters**: Wrapper component that combines all filter components
- **ProductGrid**: Displays products in a responsive grid with pagination
- **ProductHeader**: Shows results count and sorting options

### Filter Components

Each filter component is modular and can be easily updated or extended:

- **CategoryFilter**: Handles product category selection
- **PriceRangeFilter**: Manages price range with min/max inputs
- **CustomerReviewsFilter**: Star rating filter with review counts
- **BrandFilter**: Brand selection with checkboxes
- **CollectionFilter**: Special collections like "New", "Trending", etc.
- **ShippingFilter**: Shipping options like "Free shipping"

## Usage

```tsx
import { DiscoverProducts } from '@/components/discover'

// In your page component
export default function DiscoverPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DiscoverProducts />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each filter is a separate component for easy maintenance
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better development experience
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new filters or modify existing ones

## Adding New Filters

To add a new filter:

1. Create a new component in the `filters/` directory
2. Export it from `filters/index.ts`
3. Import and use it in `ProductFilters.tsx`
4. Update the filters state in `DiscoverProducts.tsx`

## State Management

The main state is managed in `DiscoverProducts.tsx`:

```tsx
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  categories: [],
  priceRange: { min: "", max: "" },
  ratings: [],
  brands: [],
  collections: [],
  freeShipping: false
})
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add filter persistence in URL
- Implement filter combinations
- Add filter analytics
- Support for dynamic filters from API
- Advanced search functionality
- Filter presets
- Mobile-optimized filter drawer

## Performance Considerations

- Filters are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Product grid uses virtualization for large datasets
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for better initial page load

## Accessibility

- All checkboxes have proper labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for filter interactions
