# 🚀 TechPotli - Vercel Deployment Guide

## ⚡ Quick Deploy (1-2 minutes)

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Import your GitHub repository**
4. **IMPORTANT: Set Root Directory to `Frontend`**
5. **Click "Deploy"**

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (Fastest)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (from Frontend folder)
vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 Why Your Previous Deployment Failed

The 404 error happened because:
- ✅ Your code is in the `Frontend/` folder
- ❌ Vercel was looking in the root directory
- ❌ It couldn't find your Next.js app

## 🎯 Critical Settings for Vercel

### Root Directory: `Frontend`
- This tells Vercel where to find your `package.json`
- Without this, Vercel can't detect Next.js

### Build Settings (Auto-detected)
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `npm install`

## 🚨 If You Still Get 404

1. **Check Root Directory setting**
2. **Make sure it's exactly `Frontend`** (capital F)
3. **Redeploy after changing settings**

## 📱 What You'll See After Deployment

- **Modern e-commerce interface**
- **Multi-language support**
- **Responsive design**
- **All your latest changes**

## 🎉 Success Checklist

- [ ] Root Directory set to `Frontend`
- [ ] Build successful (no errors)
- [ ] Site accessible via Vercel URL
- [ ] No more 404 errors
